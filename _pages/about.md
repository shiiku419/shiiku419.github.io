I am a Software Engineer at [ExaWizards Inc.](https://exawizards.com/) and a PhD student at [Shizuoka University](https://www.shizuoka.ac.jp/), where I am part of the [Cognitive Communication Laboratory](http://cog.cs.inf.shizuoka.ac.jp/recreation.html). I also hold a guest affiliation with the [CoCoCo Group](https://www.norijacoby.com/cococo.html) led by [Nori Jacoby](https://www.norijacoby.com/), which originated at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics and is now based at Cornell University.

My research focuses on the cognitive science underlying human decision-making and mental representations, and how such representations emerge through social interaction. I approach these questions using reinforcement learning techniques and large language models.
