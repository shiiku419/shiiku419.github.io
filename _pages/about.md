I am a Master student at [Shizuoka University](https://www.shizuoka.ac.jp/) where I am part of the [Cognitive Communication Laboratory](http://cog.cs.inf.shizuoka.ac.jp/recreation.html). And under a guest affiliation at [Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/), [Computational Auditory Perception group](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/forschung/forschungsgruppe-computational-auditory-perception.html) under the supervision of [Nori Jacoby](https://www.norijacoby.com/). My research focuses on the cognitive science that support and shape our decision making and cognitive abilities, and on how those representations are themselves emerged by human interaction. I address these issue, both by applying reinforcement learning techniques, and Large Language Models.

I am a Software Engineer Intern at the [MetaData Inc.](https://metadata.co.jp/) since July 2021.
